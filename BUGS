For x86_64 there seems to be a compiler bug in gcc 3.3.3. The code
is not working with the default sse2 optimisation done by the compiler
and now switched of with mfpmath=387. It has to be checked, whether this 
is really a compiler bug, a strange interplay between our sse2 units and 
the compiler units or a bug in the code (17.08.2004)

bug in the serial version of the code fixed. (16.08.2004)

there are now two exchange routines for the spinor fields, since at
least on the iwarp pc cluster the version with MPI_Type_vector is not
working for small local lattices. Maybe this is a bug in the MPI
implementation, but maybe not ...
Seems to be a bug in the MPI driver for infiniband. (17.08.2004)

write and read of spinor fields not yet tested

--disable-mpi will be configured correctly, but the code is not correct. --> fixed
