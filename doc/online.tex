\subsection{Online Measurements}

The HMC program includes the possibility to perform a certain number
of measurements after every trajectory \emph{online}, whether or not
the configuration is stored on disk. Some of those are done per
default, namely all that are written to the output file {\ttfamily
  output.data}: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item the plaquette expectation value, defined as:
  \[
  \langle P\rangle = \frac{1}{6 V}\ \sum_{\substack{
        \mu,\nu=1\ 1\leq\mu<\nu}}^4\{1-\re\tr(U^{1\times1}_{x,\mu,\nu})\}\, ,
  \]
  where $V$ is the global lattice volume.
\item the rectangle expectation value, defined as:
  \[
  \langle R\rangle = \frac{1}{12V}\ \sum_{\substack{\mu,\nu=1 \mu\neq\nu}}^4\{1
    -\re\tr(U^{1\times2}_{x,\mu,\nu})\}
  \]
\item $\Delta\mathcal{H}$ and $\exp(-\Delta\mathcal{H})$ defined in
  the obvious way.
\end{enumerate}
See the overview section for details about the {\ttfamily output.data}
file. These observables all come with no extra computational cost.

Optionally, other online mesurements can be performed, which --
however -- need in general extra inversions of the Dirac
operator. First of all the computation of certain correlation
functions is implemented. They need \emph{one} extra inversion of the
Dirac operator, as discussed in Ref.~\cite{Boucaud:2008xu}, using the
one-end-trick. Define a stochastic source $\xi$ as follows
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:source}
  \lim_{R\to\infty}[\xi_i^*\xi_j] = \delta_{ij},\quad
  \lim_{R\to\infty}[\xi_i\xi_j] = 0\, .
\end{equation}
Here $i$ labels all degrees of freedom. Then
\begin{equation}
  \label{oneend}
  [\phi_i^{r*}\phi_j^r]_R = M_{ik}^{-1*}\cdot M_{jk}^{-1} +
  \textrm{noise}\, ,
\end{equation}
if $\phi$ was computed from
\[
\phi_j^r  = M^{-1}_{jk}\xi_k^r\, .
\]
Having in mind the $\gamma_5$-hermiticity property of the Wilson and
Wilson twisted mass Dirac propagator $G_{u,d}$, i.e.
\[
G_u(x,y) = \gamma_5 G_d(y,x)^\dagger \gamma_5
\]
it is clear that eq.~(\ref{oneend}) can be used to evaluate
\[
C_\pi(t) = \langle \tr[G_u(0,t)\gamma_5 G_d(t,0)\gamma_5]\rangle =
\langle \tr[G_u(0,t) G_u(0,t)^\dagger]\rangle
\]
with only one inversion. But, even if the one gamma structure at the
source is fixed to be $\gamma_5$ due to the $\gamma_5$-hermiticity
trick, we are still free insert any $\gamma$-structure $\Gamma$ at the source,
i.e. we can evaluate any correlation function of the form
\[
C_{P\Gamma}(t) = \langle\tr[G_u(0,t) \gamma_5 G_d(t,0) \Gamma]\rangle
= \langle \tr[G_u(0,t) G_u(0,t)^\dagger\gamma_5\Gamma]\rangle\, .
\]
Useful combinations of correlation functions are $\langle P P\rangle$,
$\langle PA\rangle$ and $\langle PV\rangle$, with
\[
  P^\alpha = \bar\chi \gamma_5 \frac{\tau^\alpha}{2}\chi\, ,\quad
  V^\alpha_\mu = \bar\chi \gamma_\mu\frac{\tau^\alpha}{2}\chi\, ,\quad
  A^\alpha_\mu = \bar\chi \gamma_5\gamma_\mu\frac{\tau^\alpha}{2}\chi
\]
From $\langle P P\rangle$ one can extract the pseudo scalar mass, and
-- in the twisted mass case -- the pseudo scalar decay
constant. $\langle PA\rangle$ can be used together with $\langle P
P\rangle$ to extract the so called PCAC quark mass and $\langle
PV\rangle$ to measure the renormalisation constant $Z_\mathrm{V}$. For
details we refer the reader to Ref.~\cite{Boucaud:2008xu}.

These online measurements are controlled with the input parameters
{\ttfamily PerformOnlineMeasurements} to switch them on or off and
{\ttfamily OnlineMeasurementsFreq} to specify the frequency. The three
correlation functions are saved in files named {\ttfamily
  onlinemeas.n}, where {\ttfamily n} is the trajectory number. Every
file contains five columns, specifying the type, the operator type and the
Euclidean time $t$. The last two colums are the values of the
correlation function itself, $C(t)$ and $C(-t)$, respectively. The
type is equal to $1$, $2$ or $6$ for the $\langle P P\rangle$, the
$\langle PA\rangle$ and the $\langle PV\rangle$ correlation
functions. The operator type is for online measurements always equal
to $1$ for local source and sink (no smearing of any kind), and the
time runs from $0$ to $T/2$. Hence, $C(-t)= C(T-t)$. $C(-0)$ and
$C(-T/2)$ are set to zero for convenience.

In addition to correlation functions also the minimal and the maximal
eigenvalues of the $(\gamma_5 D)^2$ can be measured.

An online measurement not related to physics, but related to the
algorithm are checks of reversibility violations. The HMC algorithm is
exact, if 
and only if the integration scheme is reversible. On a computer with
finite precision this is only guaranteed up to machine precision.
These violations can be estimated by integrating a trajectory
forward and then backward in Monte Carlo time. The difference among
the original Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}$ and the final one
$\mathcal{H}''$ after integrating back can serve as one measure for
those violations, another one is provided by the difference among the
original gauge field $U$ and the final one $U''$
\[
\delta\Delta U = \frac{1}{12V}
\sum_{x,\mu}\sum_{i,j} (U_{x,\mu}-U_{x,\mu}'')_{i,j}^2
\]
where we indicate with the $\delta\Delta$ that this is obtained after
integrating a trajectory forward and backward in time. The results for
$\delta\Delta \mathcal{H}$ and $\delta\Delta U$ are
stored in the file {\ttfamily return\_check.data}. The relevant input
parameters are {\ttfamily ReversibilityCheck} and {\ttfamily
  ReversibilityCheckInterval}.

\subsection{Iterative Solver and Eigensolver}

There are several iterative solvers implemented in the tmLQCD
package for solving 
\[
D\ \chi = \phi
\]
for $\chi$. The minimal residual (MR), the conjugate gradient (CG), the
conjugate gradient squared (CGS), the generalised minimal residual
(GMRES), the generalised conjugate residual and the stabilised
bi-conjugate gradient (BiCGstab). For details regarding these
algorithms we refer to Refs.~\cite{saad:2003a,meister:1999}.

For the {\ttfamily hmc\_tm} executable only the CG and the BiCGstab
solvers are available, while all the others can be used in the
{\ttfamily invert} executables. Most of them are both available with
and without even/odd preconditioning. For a performance comparison we
refer to Ref.~\cite{Chiarappa:2004ry,Chiarappa:2006hz}.

The stopping criterion is implemented in two ways: the first is an
absolute stopping criterion, i.e. the solver is stopped when the
squared norm of the residual vector (depending on the solver this
might be the iterated residual or the real residual) fulfilles
\[
\|r\|^2 < \epsilon^2\, .
\]
The second is relative to the source vector, i.e.
\[
\frac{\|r\|^2}{\|\phi\|^2} < \epsilon^2\, .
\]
The value of $\epsilon^2$ and relative of absolute precision can be
influenced via input parameters.

The reduced precision Dirac operator, as discussed in sub-section
\ref{sec:dirac}, is available for the CG solver. In the CG solver the 
full precision Dirac operator is only required at the beginning of the
CG search, because the relative size of the contribution to the
resulting vector decreases with the number of iterations. Thus, as soon
as a certain precision is achived in the CG algorithm we can switch to
the reduced precision Dirac operator without spoiling the precision of
the final result. Our experience is that this switch can be performed
when the precision is $\sqrt{\epsilon}$ is reached where aiming for a
final precision of $\epsilon < 1$.

The eigensolver used to compute the eigenvalues (and vectors) of
$(\gamma_5 D)^2$ is the so called Jacobi-Davidson 
method~\cite{Sleijpen:1996aa,Geus:2002}. For a discussion for the
application of this algorithm to lattice QCD we refer again to
Ref.~\cite{Chiarappa:2004ry,Chiarappa:2006hz}. 

All solver related files can be found in the sub-directory {\ttfamily
  solver}. Note that there are a few more solvers implemented which
are, however, in an experimental status.

\subsection{Stout Smearing}

Smearing techniques have become an important tool to reduce
ultraviolet fluctuations in the gauge fields. One of those techniques,
coming with the advantage of being usable in the MD update, is usually
called stout smearing~\cite{Morningstar:2003gk}. 

The $(n+1)^{\rm th}$ level of stout smeared gauge links is obtained iteratively
from the $n^{\rm th}$ level by
\begin{equation*}
  U_\mu^{(n+1)}(x)\;=\;e^{i\,Q_\mu^{(n)}(x)}\,U_\mu^{(n)}(x).
\end{equation*}
We refer to the unsmeared (``thin'') gauge field as $U_\mu\equiv
U_\mu^{(0)}$.
The ${\rm SU}(3)$ matrices $Q_\mu$ are defined via the staples $C_\mu$:
\begin{eqnarray}
  Q_\mu^{(n)}(x) &=& \frac{i}2\Big[U^{(n)}_\mu(x){C_\mu^{(n)}}^\dagger(x)
  - {\mathrm{h.c.}}\Big]\,-\,\frac{i}{6}\tr\Big[U^{(n)}_\mu(x){C_\mu^{(n)}}^\dagger(x)
  - {\mathrm{h.c.}}\Big]\,,\nonumber\\
  C_\mu^{(n)} &=& \sum_{\nu\neq\mu}\,\rho_{\mu\nu}\,
  \Big(U_\nu^{(n)}(x)U_\mu^{(n)}(x+\hat\nu){U_\nu^{(n)}}^\dagger(x+\hat\mu)
  \nonumber\\
  && \;\;\;
  +{U_\nu^{(n)}}^\dagger(x-\hat\nu)U_\mu^{(n)}(x-\hat\nu)U_\nu^{(n)}(x-\hat\nu+\hat\mu)
  \Big)\,,\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where in general $\rho_{\mu\nu}$ is the smearing matrix.
In the tmLQCD package we have only implemented isotropic $4$-dimensional
smearing, i.e., $\rho_{\mu\nu}=\rho$.

Currently stout smearing is only implemented for the {\ttfamily
  invert} executables. I.e. the gauge field can be stout smeared at
the beginning of an inversion. The input parameters are {\ttfamily
  UseStoutSmearing}, {\ttfamily StoutRho} and {\ttfamily
  StoutNoIterations}.
