\section{Even/odd preconditioning vs.\ no even/odd preconditioning}

There are now new operators that act on ``full size'' spinors, which store spinors on the full VOLUME of the lattice. These operators are (like all operators) in \texttt{tm\_operators.c}. Specifically we have so far (Oct. 5, 2007)
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
$\hat{Q}_+$ & \texttt{Q\_plus\_psi(spinor * const l, spinor * const k)}\\
$\hat{Q}_-$ & \texttt{Q\_minus\_psi(spinor * const l, spinor * const k)}\\
$\hat{Q}_+ \hat{Q}_-$ & \texttt{Q\_pm\_psi(spinor * const l, spinor * const k)}
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
All these operators are based on the operator $D_\psi$ defined in \texttt{D\_psi.c}\\


The sandwiching $\delta S_b$ with even/odd preconditioning is done in \texttt{deriv\_Sb.c}, whereas in the non-preconditioned case this is handled in \texttt{deriv\_Sb\_D\_psi.c}. All this is handled within \texttt{derivative\_psf.c}, so the integration scheme code does not need to distinguish between the the two cases (even/odd preconditioning vs.\ no even/odd preconditioning).
