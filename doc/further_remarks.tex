\section{Further remarks}
\begin{itemize}
\item{}the conversion of SU(3) matrices to and from the adjoint representation is not bijective. If a matrix $A$ is converted by \texttt{\_trace\_lambda(B,A)} the result $B$ must be divided by $-2$, if the inverse routine \texttt{\_make\_su3(A,B)} is to reproduce the original $A$.  
\item{}possibly the non even/odd operator combination $\gamma_5 D_\psi$ should be implemented more efficiently 
\end{itemize}
