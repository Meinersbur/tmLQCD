Benchmark of the even-odd preconditioned Dirac operator

The program is compiled with the file ccc
It needs to be edited to give the proper path for the mpicc.
Maybe also the compile-option has to be adopted.
In particular
-DSSE2 -DP4  
should only be given for a Pentium4 (R) system.
And
-DSSE -DOPTERON
should only be given for a AMD Opteron (R) system.

You should allways set -D_GAUGE_COPY and -D_NEW_GEOMERY.

There are two different parallelisations available, a one dimensionale
parallelisation (set -DPARALLELT) and a two dimensional
parallelisation (set -DPARALLELXT). If none of the two is used, you
will get a serial version of the program.

The local lattice size in the case of the one dimensional
prallelisation is controlled by the parameters 

#define T   2
#define L  16

which will give a 2 x 16^3 local lattice, the total size of the
lattice is given by 

(number of processes) times T  times L^3

In the two dimensional parallelisation by

#define T   2
#define L  16
#define N_PROC_X 2

which will give a 2 x 8 x 16^2 local lattice. In this case the total
size of the lattice is given by

(number of processes)/N_PROC_X times T  times L^3 .

They can all be found in the file global.h . These are the only things
you should touch in the program. L should be even. also (number of processes) should
be even.

the package size of the data that are send and recieved is 
192 * (1/2) * L^3 Byte in case of the one dimensional parallelisation.
In case of the two dimensional parallelisation it is
192 * (1/2) ((L*L*L/N_PROC_X)+(T*L*L)) Byte.

A run of the benchmark takes about one minute.

The out-put of the program is: (T=2,L=16 on lattice in Hamburg)

The number of processes is 12 
The local lattice size is 2 x 16 ^3 
total time 4.681349e+00 sec, Variance of the time 6.314982e-03 sec 

 (297 Mflops [64 bit arithmetic])

communication switched off 
 (577 Mflops [64 bit arithmetic])

The size of the package is 393216 Byte 
The bandwidth is 84.49 + 84.49   MB/sec


If you use the serial version of course the part depending on the
parallel setup will be missing.
