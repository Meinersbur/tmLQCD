20.08.2004: SSE3 Version of the most important macros added and
	    tested. SSE3 versus SSE2: 1.84 Gflops versus 1.64 Gflops.
            (P4  3.20GHz prescott)

17.08.2004: 64 Bit Version of the code running and tested
	    Cache Optimisation for Opteron added.
	    New configure options: 
	    --enable-opteron   : Enables cache optimisation 
	                         for Opteron                [default=no]
	    --enable-gaugecopy : Enables usage of a copy of 
	                         the gauge field            [default=yes]
	    --enable-eogeom    : Enables usage of EO geometry 
				 also for the gauge fields  [default=yes]

13.08.2004  New EO geometry for gauge fields implemented also
	    for the 2-dim parallelisation and tested.

04.05.2004: additional parallelisation in x-direction added
	    and tested. IO added as well and tested, apart
	    from write and read for spinor fields.
	    extended test functions written (hmc/test)

05.04.2004: Bug fix. serial version without MPI running now.
	    Bug was in geometry_eo.c
	    program for thermal cycles added.

11.03.2004: third pseudo fermion field added and tested.

09.03.2004: .nstore_counter file introduced to easily restart the
	    programm. Just set InitialStoreCounter = readin. Also a
	    sighandler was added to savely finish the program.

04.03.2004: Hasenbusch trick tested and working.
	    New version of the Hopping matrix for the IBM implemented
	    with special improvements. Even Odd ordering translated
	    also to the gauge fields and tested, but not yet default.

03.03.2004: second pseudo fermion (trick of Martin Hasenbusch)
	    implemented also for tmQCD

02.03.2004: Release 1.0.1
