29.01.2006: running and partially tested on the BGL in Juelich 
	    configure with
	    ./configure --host=powerpc64-bgl-linux-gnu --without-lapack CC=/opt/ibmcmp/vac/7.0/bin/blrts_xlc
	    and other options. Also lime needs to be configured
	    with ./configure CC=/opt/ibmcmp/vac/7.0/bin/blrts_xlc
	    please use lime-1.2.3 _at least_! Earlier version might not
	    work.

25.01.2006: Trying to setup a versioning system:
	    last digit -> bug fixes
	    second digit odd -> developement Version
	    second digit even -> stable release

25.01.2006: changed --disalbe-lapack to --without-lapack ...

05.01.2006: By setting the history parameters for the CSG to zero one gets
	    now a zero spinor as trial guess for the solvers.
	    Moreover, by specifying --disable-lapack to configure it is
	    possible to compile without the need of the external libs lapack
	    and blas and the fortran-lib.

14.11.2005: For the flavour non-degenerate eigenvalues computation, a new 
            structure, called bispinor, has been introduced. Consequently, 
            a serial and a parallel new Jacoby-Davidson routine working 
            with bispinors has been implemented, as well as two new solvers, 
            bicgstab_complex and cg_her, respectively. A bunch of linear 
            algebra files have been adapted to work with bispinors. All these 
            files are distinguished by the suffix "_bi" (e.g: "file_bi.c").

14.11.2005: New global parameters (g_mubar, g_epsbar) have been introduced. 
            These are the mass parameters needed in the eigenvalues 
            computation of the flavour non-degenerate case Dirac operator.

11.11.2005: gcc-4.x does not use libg2c anymore. One has to link 
	    against gfortran, which is done now.

26.10.2005: Added gauge file format conversion programs for
	    gwc -> ildg and ildg -> gwc

	    All solver have additional parameter now. It is now possible
	    to invert with realtive precision. Moreover, the propagator 
	    (or source) format of Chris Michael can be read in.
	    The new input parameter is:
	    SourceFormat = cmi (otherwise gwc assumed)
	    other related input parameters are
	    ReadSource = yes
	    SolverPrecision = 1.e-10
	    SourceInputFilename = random_test
	    UseRelativePrecision = yes

11.08.2005: 2MN integrator implemented and tested. Two versions
	    available: velocity and position version (hep-lat/0505020).
	    Integrator=2MN or 2MNposition

29.06.2005: ILDG LIME file format introduced.
	    old file format deprecated. But it will be still
	    automatically detected and read in.
	
	    trajectory counter introduced which will now allow
	    to correctly keep the Nskip's between the confs.
	    this is as well as the plaquette value stored as 
	    xlf-info record in the new LIME format.

10.03.2005: Precisions in the solver for force and Acceptance are input
	    parameter now for each mu parameter:
  	    ForcePrecisionMu, ForcePrecisionMu2, ForcePrecisionMu3
	    AcceptancePrecisionMu, 
	    AcceptancePrecisionMu2, AcceptancePrecisionMu3
	   
	    ExtIntStepsMu0 is now called IntegrationStepsMu,
	    ExtIntStepsMu1 is now called IntegrationStepsMu2,
	    ExtIntStepsMu2 is now called IntegrationStepsMu3,
	    matchin the input names for the mu parameter.
	    The old one are still usable.

	    Added an input parameter DebugLevel to control the 
	    debug output. Setting it to one will cause the program
	    to compute and print out the norms of the forces.

17.02.2005: Reversibility check implemented. Input parameters are
	    ReversibilityCheck = yes|no (default no)
	    ReversibilityCheckIntervall = 100 (default 100)

	    Precisions in the solver for force and Acceptance are input
	    parameter now:
  	    ForcePrecision = float (default 1.e-7)
	    AcceptancePrecision = float (default 16.e-7)
  	    
	    One can choose to have relative precision:
	    UseRelativePrecision = yes|no (default no)

13.02.2005: Integration scheme with error cancellation implemented.
            It is only implemented for the highest level and should
	    have errors in \delta\tau^5 only.

07.02.2005: LX,LY,LZ now possible as input parameter.

07.01.2005: Extended leap-frog and extended Sexton-Weingarten
	    integration schemes (multiple time scales) implemented 
	    and tested.

17.12.2004: Possibility for rereading some parameters added.
	    If there is a file hmc.reread, it will be parsed
	    automatically and deleted afterwards. It is not possible
	    to change T, L, RGIC1 from zero to a non zero value, NrXProcs.

13.12.2004: Extended leapfrog integration scheme implemented
	    and tested. 

23.11.2004: The lattice size must be now set in the input file.
	    Recompilation is only needed for one or two dimensional
	    parallelisation.
	    
	    For invert there is a new input parameter:
	    ReadSource = yes|no
	    SourceInputFilename = filename
	    This let's you read in a generalised source for the
  	    inversion. The real filename must be of the form
	    filename${massnumber}.is${is}ic${ic}.${nstore}

22.11.2004: DBW2 implemented for the serial code and the parallel
	    code with new and old geometry.
	    Input parameter BoundaryCond is supplemented by
	    BCAngleT, like in the GWC code. BoundaryCond is 
	    deprecated now.

28.09.2004: input parameter added:
	    input parameter MaxSolverIterations 
	    and SolverPrecision available.

	    history_hmc_tm file added with history of
	    written configurations and corresponding 
	    Plaquette values and timestamp

20.08.2004: SSE3 Version of the most important macros added and
	    tested. SSE3 versus SSE2: 1.84 Gflops versus 1.64 Gflops.
            (P4  3.20GHz prescott)

17.08.2004: 64 Bit Version of the code running and tested
	    Cache Optimisation for Opteron added.
	    New configure options: 
	    --enable-opteron   : Enables cache optimisation 
	                         for Opteron                [default=no]
	    --enable-gaugecopy : Enables usage of a copy of 
	                         the gauge field            [default=yes]
	    --enable-eogeom    : Enables usage of EO geometry 
				 also for the gauge fields  [default=yes]

13.08.2004  New EO geometry for gauge fields implemented also
	    for the 2-dim parallelisation and tested.

04.05.2004: additional parallelisation in x-direction added
	    and tested. IO added as well and tested, apart
	    from write and read for spinor fields.
	    extended test functions written (hmc/test)

05.04.2004: Bug fix. serial version without MPI running now.
	    Bug was in geometry_eo.c
	    program for thermal cycles added.

11.03.2004: third pseudo fermion field added and tested.

09.03.2004: .nstore_counter file introduced to easily restart the
	    programm. Just set InitialStoreCounter = readin. Also a
	    sighandler was added to savely finish the program.

04.03.2004: Hasenbusch trick tested and working.
	    New version of the Hopping matrix for the IBM implemented
	    with special improvements. Even Odd ordering translated
	    also to the gauge fields and tested, but not yet default.

03.03.2004: second pseudo fermion (trick of Martin Hasenbusch)
	    implemented also for tmQCD

02.03.2004: Release 1.0.1
