17.02.2005: Reversibility check implemented. Input parameters are
	    ReversibilityCheck = yes|no (default no)
	    ReversibilityCheckIntervall = 100 (default 100)

	    Precisions in the solver for force and Acceptance are input
	    parameter now:
  	    ForcePrecision = float (default 1.e-7)
	    AcceptancePrecision = float (default 16.e-7)
  	    
	    One can choose to have relative precision:
	    UseRelativePrecision = yes|no (default no)

13.02.2005: Integration scheme with error cancellation implemented.
            It is only implemented for the highest level and should
	    have errors in \delta\tau^5 only.

07.02.2005: LX,LY,LZ now possible as input parameter.

07.01.2005: Extended leap-frog and extended Sexton-Weingarten
	    integration schemes (multiple time scales) implemented 
	    and tested.

17.12.2004: Possibility for rereading some parameters added.
	    If there is a file hmc.reread, it will be parsed
	    automatically and deleted afterwards. It is not possible
	    to change T, L, RGIC1 from zero to a non zero value, NrXProcs.

13.12.2004: Extended leapfrog integration scheme implemented
	    and tested. 

23.11.2004: The lattice size must be now set in the input file.
	    Recompilation is only needed for one or two dimensional
	    parallelisation.
	    
	    For invert there is a new input parameter:
	    ReadSource = yes|no
	    SourceInputFilename = filename
	    This let's you read in a generalised source for the
  	    inversion. The real filename must be of the form
	    filename${massnumber}.is${is}ic${ic}.${nstore}

22.11.2004: DBW2 implemented for the serial code and the parallel
	    code with new and old geometry.
	    Input parameter BoundaryCond is supplemented by
	    BCAngleT, like in the GWC code. BoundaryCond is 
	    deprecated now.

28.09.2004: input parameter added:
	    input parameter MaxSolverIterations 
	    and SolverPrecision available.

	    history_hmc_tm file added with history of
	    written configurations and corresponding 
	    Plaquette values and timestamp

20.08.2004: SSE3 Version of the most important macros added and
	    tested. SSE3 versus SSE2: 1.84 Gflops versus 1.64 Gflops.
            (P4  3.20GHz prescott)

17.08.2004: 64 Bit Version of the code running and tested
	    Cache Optimisation for Opteron added.
	    New configure options: 
	    --enable-opteron   : Enables cache optimisation 
	                         for Opteron                [default=no]
	    --enable-gaugecopy : Enables usage of a copy of 
	                         the gauge field            [default=yes]
	    --enable-eogeom    : Enables usage of EO geometry 
				 also for the gauge fields  [default=yes]

13.08.2004  New EO geometry for gauge fields implemented also
	    for the 2-dim parallelisation and tested.

04.05.2004: additional parallelisation in x-direction added
	    and tested. IO added as well and tested, apart
	    from write and read for spinor fields.
	    extended test functions written (hmc/test)

05.04.2004: Bug fix. serial version without MPI running now.
	    Bug was in geometry_eo.c
	    program for thermal cycles added.

11.03.2004: third pseudo fermion field added and tested.

09.03.2004: .nstore_counter file introduced to easily restart the
	    programm. Just set InitialStoreCounter = readin. Also a
	    sighandler was added to savely finish the program.

04.03.2004: Hasenbusch trick tested and working.
	    New version of the Hopping matrix for the IBM implemented
	    with special improvements. Even Odd ordering translated
	    also to the gauge fields and tested, but not yet default.

03.03.2004: second pseudo fermion (trick of Martin Hasenbusch)
	    implemented also for tmQCD

02.03.2004: Release 1.0.1
