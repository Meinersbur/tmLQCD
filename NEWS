04.05.2004: additional parallelisation in x-direction added
	    and tested. IO added as well and tested, apart
	    from write and read for spinor fields.
	    extended test functions written (hmc/test)

05.04.2004: Bug fix. serial version without MPI running now.
	    Bug was in geometry_eo.c
	    program for thermal cycles added.

11.03.2004: third pseudo fermion field added and tested.

09.03.2004: .nstore_counter file introduced to easily restart the
	    programm. Just set InitialStoreCounter = readin. Also a
	    sighandler was added to savely finish the program.

04.03.2004: Hasenbusch trick tested and working.
	    New version of the Hopping matrix for the IBM implemented
	    with special improvements. Even Odd ordering translated
	    also to the gauge fields and tested, but not yet default.

03.03.2004: second pseudo fermion (trick of Martin Hasenbusch)
	    implemented also for tmQCD

02.03.2004: Release 1.0.1
