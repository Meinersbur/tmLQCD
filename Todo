- SourceSink_Pairs propagator format broken for 2 fl. tmwilson

- source generation inside the code
- lime headers for propagators and sources
- deflation
- inverter for overlap (needs a new structure, partially available)
- mixed precision solver, single precision Dirac operator
- GPU implementation...
- test RHMC?
- dynamical overlap code
- create simpler test suite
