- clean up source generation plus source input filename scheme
- parallel IO for propagators
- deflation
- inverter for overlap (needs a new structure, partially available)
- mixed precision solver, single precision Dirac operator
- GPU implementation...
- test RHMC?
- dynamical overlap code
- create simpler test suite
