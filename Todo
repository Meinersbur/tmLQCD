For PHMC:
- cleaning up the code.
- make more integration schemes available
- phmc with nf=2 degenerate

For Blue Gene/L:
- tune get_staples and get_rectangular_staples (su3_times_su3, prefetching)
- tune xchange_gauge and xchange_deri like xchange_field
- linear algebra: add __alignx and unrolling in the most important routines.
  maybe write for the most important ones versions with intrinsic functions
- the usage of the random number generator should be changed for this machine
  moreover a usage should be available for testing which reproduces
  exactly the scalar case.
