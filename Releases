Release 2.2:
DBW2 inplemented and working. New input parameter:
RGIC1 = floating point number
memory dynamically allocated now.

Release 2.1:
working and optimised for x86_64 and AMD Opteron. benchmark tool
added. Even Odd geometry also for the gauge fields and the possibility
to use a copy of the gauge fields for a better cache usage.
New configure options: 
--enable-opteron   : Enables cache optimisation for Opteron [default=no]
--enable-gaugecopy : Enables usage of a copy of the gauge field [default=yes]
--enable-eogeom    : Enables usage of EO geometry also for the gauge fields [default=yes]

Release 2.0:
second parallel direction introduced

Release 1.2.0:
Implementation of the Hasebusch trick with a third pseudo fermion
field.

Release 1.1.0:
Implementation of the Hasenbusch trick with two pseudo fermion
fields. This is also tested.

Release 1.0.1:
fully parallelized tm, Wilson and clover impr. dynamical QCD code with
SSE2 improvement for P4 and improvement for IBM power4. Serial version
gives not the correct results. EO order implemented for also for the
gauge fields, but not yet switched on per default. To do so one has to
undef OlD in geometry_eo.c and xchange.c. This order will not yet work
with clover improved Wilson.
