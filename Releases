Release 1.2.0:
Implementation of the Hasebusch trick with a third pseudo fermion
field.

Release 1.1.0:
Implementation of the Hasenbusch trick with two pseudo fermion
fields. This is also tested.

Release 1.0.1:
fully parallelized tm, Wilson and clover impr. dynamical QCD code with
SSE2 improvement for P4 and improvement for IBM power4. Serial version
gives not the correct results. EO order implemented for also for the
gauge fields, but not yet switched on per default. To do so one has to
undef OlD in geometry_eo.c and xchange.c. This order will not yet work
with clover improved Wilson.
